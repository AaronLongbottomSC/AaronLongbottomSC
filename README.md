- 👋 Hi there everyone, I’m @AaronLongbottomSC
- 👀 I’m really curious around integrations and how APIs can be leveraged to help automate process across a business or department.
- 🌱 As an integrations newbie, I’m currently learning how to use GitHub, as well as designing and building automation workflows.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborating with customers and colleagues in creating these and brainstorming amazing ideas.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me by phone (+44 113 733 0458) or email (aaron.longbottom@safetyculture.io) if you have any questions.
